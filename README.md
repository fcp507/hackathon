## Inspiration
MLB teams annually face the challenge of identifying future stars while avoiding draft busts. Inspired by the Moneyball revolution and AI-driven scouting, we created Diamond AIâ€”a system designed to revolutionize MLB prospect evaluation using cutting-edge AI techniques. Our goal is to make scouting more data-driven, predictive, and insightful, while also uncovering hidden stars that might otherwise be overlooked. Diamond AI integrates seamlessly with traditional prediction models, enhancing them with advanced AI capabilities. It features robust player comparison tools, allowing scouts to evaluate prospects against both historical and current player data for comprehensive analysis. To achieve even more advanced statistics and insights, we utilized GenAI Gemini from Google, providing a powerful search tool to refine our evaluations and predictions further.

## What It Does
Diamond AI is a multi-agent system that automates complete scouting workflows, powered by:
- âœ… LangGraphâ€™s structured reasoning framework (Plan & Execute agents).
- âœ… Google Gemini 2â€™s advanced language and data-processing capabilities.
- âœ… Live data integration via Google Search, BigQuery, and third-party APIs.

For any MLB prospect, Diamond AI executes a multi-step workflow, including:
1. Gathering real-time player statistics (batting, pitching, fielding) from trusted sources.
2. Checking injury history using BigQuery and medical reports.
3. Analyzing performance trends (seasonal and game-by-game breakdowns) with the Gemini 2 Google search tool.
4. Comparing the prospect to similar MLB players using AI-driven historical analysis.
5. Predicting draft selection probability based on machine learning models.
6. Synthesizing all insights into a final scouting report, grounded in real-world data.

## How We Built It
ðŸš€ **Tech Stack**:
- **LangGraph (Plan & Execute Agent)**: Structured AI decision-making.
- **Google Gemini AI**: Natural language & scouting insights.
- **Chainlit**: Interactive chat-based AI interface.
- **Flask**: Backend API.
- **Jinja2**: Player dashboard.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Scalable deployment.

The Plan & Execute agent was keyâ€”it dynamically generated step-by-step scouting workflows, ensuring the AI made structured and logical evaluations.

## Challenges We Faced
- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Integrating live stats while maintaining accuracy.
- **Scouting Complexity**: Balancing AI predictions with traditional scouting methodologies.
- **Cloud Deployment Issues**: Optimizing Chainlit + LangGraph on GCP.

## What We Learned
- LangGraphâ€™s structured reasoning significantly improves AI decision-making.
- AI predictions must be paired with human scouting expertise for optimal results.
- A well-designed agent-based AI can automate complex workflows, saving time for MLB analysts.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
- âš¾ Enhancing AIâ€™s comparison models to better match prospects with MLB veterans.
- âš¾ Adding biomechanical video analysis for deeper scouting insights.
- âš¾ Expanding to minor league performance tracking for post-draft evaluations.

With Diamond AI, weâ€™re bringing the future of AI-powered scouting to baseball.
